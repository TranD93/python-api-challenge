# Weather Analysis

In the WeatherPy project, there are two main files: WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb. These files use data from two different sources, OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify, to collect information about over 500 cities based on specific coordinates. 

Additionally, there is an "output_data" folder that holds images created by WeatherPy.ipynb.

Both WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb use the Pandas library to organize the data into DataFrames. 

They also utilize the Matplotlib library to create scatter plots with various data variables. For statistical calculations and generating linear regression lines, Scipy and linregress are imported. 

Citipy is used to generate a list of cities based on coordinates, hvplot helps with interactive data visualization, and geoviews is used to explore and visualize data on a map.
